# Tic-Tac-Toe-Project
## Basic tic-tac-toe project using advance features of JavaFx and logic implementation using Java.
One of the most beginner friendly project to start with especially if you wanna enhance your object-oriented concepts and expand your skills in implementing UI design and graphical components. The logic for the game is also quite clear and has many ways to implement which makes it a bit distinct!
### Code Structure: 
 Project is organized into four controller classes, showcasing a modular and maintainable structure. The sequential steps in these classes guide the implementation of algorithms, allowing for systematic problem-solving. By integrating effects and animations into labels and buttons, we aim to enhance the overall user experience.

### UI Design:
Crafted the UI using Scene Builder for an efficient design process. Also incorporated CSS styling which not only enhances aesthetics but also demonstrates an understanding of styling in JavaFX. Additional icons from the Java .jar file are added to make the interface visually appealing.
### FXML Documents:
Each controller class has a dedicated FXML document, following the principle of separation of concerns.
### JavaFX VS Swing:
Choosing JavaFX over Swing is motivated by the advanced and automated tools available, simplifying UI development. Although it's my very first JavaFX project, it was easier to design and make it look appealing.
